## Project Objectives
- **Segmenting Customers**: Identifying distinct customer groups and their behaviors.
- **Analyzing Subscription Types**: Understanding the popularity of different subscription types.
- **Tracking Cancellations and Renewals**: Identifying trends in subscription renewals and cancellations.
- **Delivering Insights with Power BI**: Providing an interactive dashboard for stakeholders to explore customer data.

## Data Overview
The data contains customer information for a subscription service, with details including:
- **CustomerID**: Unique customer identifier.
- **Region**: Geographic region of the customer.
- **SubscriptionType**: Type of subscription (e.g., Basic, Premium, Standard).
- **SubscriptionStart and SubscriptionEnd**: Start and end dates for each customerâ€™s subscription.
- **Canceled**: Indicates whether the subscription was canceled.
- **Revenue**: Total revenue generated from each customer.

## Analysis Steps

### Google Sheet Analysis
The initial analysis was conducted in Excel to identify key subscription patterns:
1. **Subscription Patterns**: Created pivot tables to analyze the popularity and distribution of subscription types.
2. **Average Subscription Duration**: Calculated the average subscription duration to understand typical customer lifespans.
3. **Revenue Contribution**: Assessed revenue generated by different subscription types and regions.

### SQL Analysis
The SQL queries were designed to extract key insights and answer specific business questions:
- **Total Customers by Region**: Counts of customers in each region.
- **Most Popular Subscription Type**: Identifies the subscription type with the highest number of customers.
- **Early Cancellations**: Identifies customers who canceled within the first six months.
- **Average Subscription Duration**: Calculates the average subscription length for all customers.
- **Long-Term Subscriptions**: Finds customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
- **Revenue by Subscription Type**: Aggregates total revenue by each subscription type.
- **Top Regions for Cancellations**: Identifies regions with the most cancellations.
- **Active vs. Canceled Subscriptions**: Compares counts of active and canceled subscriptions.

### Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard brings the analysis together in an interactive format. Key visuals include:
- **Customer Segments**: Visualization of customer segments by subscription type and region.
- **Subscription Trends**: Shows trends in active subscriptions, cancellations, and renewals over time.
- **Revenue Analysis**: Visuals comparing revenue by subscription type and region.
- **Interactive Filters**: Allows filtering by region, subscription type, and cancellation status to explore specific customer groups.


## Insights & Findings
Key findings from the analysis:
- **Subscription Type Popularity**: Basic subscriptions have the highest number of customers, followed by Premium and Standard.
- **Cancellation Trends**: Early cancellations (within the first six months) were more common in the South region.
- **Revenue Contributions**: Although Basic has the most customers, Premium subscriptions contribute significantly to total revenue.
- **Customer Lifespan**: The average customer subscription duration is approximately 12 months.

## Conclusion
- **Enhance Segmentation**: Apply clustering techniques to identify finer customer segments.
- **Predict Cancellations**: Use machine learning to build a model predicting customer churn.
- **Optimize Subscription Offers**: Identify optimal pricing models to improve retention.
